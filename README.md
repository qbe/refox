# refox.py
*a firefox window repositioner for sway*

Firefox needs restarting on update, and will not remember
which sway workspace each window was on before the restart.
This sccript works around this.

## usage

Run refox.py, restart firefox when instructed to do so, then press enter.
The script will do its best to put the windows back to where they were.
